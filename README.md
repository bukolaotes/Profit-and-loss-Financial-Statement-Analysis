# Project Title: Profit and Loss Statement Financial Analysis

## Overview

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our financial oversight and performance evaluation, we are initiating a project focused on analyzing the Profit and Loss (P&L) statements across our six branches, in South-South Nigeria, over the four-year period from 2020 to 2023. This analysis will provide valuable insights into our financial activities and help inform strategic decisions moving forward.

## Objective

The aim is to analyze P&L data to understand revenue, expenses, and overall profitability across our branches. By the end of this project, we expect to have a clear picture of each branch's financial health and actionable insights to improve performance.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset  i will be working with includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the financial transaction.

Branch: The name of the branch where the transaction occurred.

Account Category: The category of the account (e.g., Revenue, Expense).

Account Name: The specific account associated with the transaction (e.g., Salaries, Loan Income).

Amount (NGN): The monetary amount of the transaction, in Nigerian Naira.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Categorize Transactions into Revenue and Expenses based on the Account Category.
•	Calculate total revenue, total Expenses and Net profit for each branch over the years.
•	Determine the percentage changes in revenue and expenses year- to year 
•	Calculate the profit Margin for each Branch

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

•	Duplicate were removed
•	All financial figures were formatted correctly

## Tools Used:

•	Microsoft Excel
•	Power business intelligence (Power bi)

## Findings
1.Revenue trends by branch and year.
•	Akwa ibom  Branch has the highest revenue of  ₦ 1,725,212,274.00 over the years(2020-2023) from the total revenue of ₦ 9,641,838,938.00 generated over the years(2020-2023).Akwa ibom Branch also generated the highest  revenue of ₦ 486,478,763.00 in the year 2021 compared to other branches and other years.

4.YoY growth % Change.
•	It was observed that cross river Branch YoY % Change for expenses is 33% while Yoy % Change for Revenue is also 33%, it suggests stability but no improvement in profit margins.

## Recommendations

•	Allocation of Resources should be made to growing Branches. Issues in underperforming Branches should be investigated and addressed.

•	There should be implementation of cost control measures where expenses consistently exceed Revenue.

•	Focus should be made on reducing high-cost expense categories.

•	Strategies that will enhance revenue in branches with low revenue should be developed.

•	Successful strategies that have been used in other high performing Branches should be identified and replicate them.

•	Revenue and Expense Targets should be set for branches based on historical data and trends.

•	Progress of all the branches should be monitored regularly.
